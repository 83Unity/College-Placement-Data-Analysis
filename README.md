# College-Placement-Data-Analysis
This projects contains analysis of student placement data to understand hiring patterns, salary trends and other insights. The goal is to understand and practice data cleaning, data visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis on a real world dataset using Python.

# Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handling missing values,
Feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
Placement rate across categories (gender, education, specialization),
Salary distribution and trends,
Correlation between features (CGPA, skills, etc.)

Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest (for placement classification),
Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor (for salary prediction)

Model Evaluations:
Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report,
MAE, RMSE, R² for regression tasks

# Tech Stack
Python,
Pandas & Numpy: Data manipulation,
Matplotlib & seaborn: Data Visualization,
Scikit-Learn: Machine Learning models & evaluation,
Jupyter Notebook – Documentation & execution

# Example Visuals
